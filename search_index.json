My assumptions about you How to use and understand this project You can do this, too We have updates", " Statistical Rethinking with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse version 1.0.1 A Solomon Kurz 2019-06-19 This is a love letter I love McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking text. It’s the entry-level textbook for applied researchers I spent years looking for. McElreath’s freely-available lectures on the book are really great, too. However, I prefer using Bürkner’s brms package when doing Bayesian regression in R. It’s just spectacular. I also prefer plotting with Wickham’s ggplot2, and coding with functions and principles from the tidyverse, which you might learn about here or here. So, this project is an attempt to reexpress the code in McElreath’s textbook. His models are re-fit with brms, the figures are reproduced or reimagined with ggplot2, and the general data wrangling code now predominantly follows the tidyverse style. Why this? I’m not a statistician and I have no formal background in computer science. Though I benefited from a suite of statistics courses in grad school, a large portion of my training has been outside of the classroom, working with messy real-world data, and searching online for help. One of the great resources I happened on was idre, the UCLA Institute for Digital Education, which offers an online portfolio of richly annotated textbook examples. Their online tutorials are among the earliest inspirations for this project. We need more resources like them. With that in mind, one of the strengths of McElreath’s text is its thorough integration with the rethinking package. The rethinking package is a part of the R ecosystem, which is great because R is free and open source. And McElreath has made the source code for rethinking publically available, too. Since he completed his text, many other packages have been developed to help users of the R ecosystem interface with Stan. Of those alternative packages, I think Bürkner’s brms is the best for general-purpose Bayesian data analysis. It’s flexible, uses reasonably-approachable syntax, has sensible defaults, and offers a vast array of post-processing convenience functions. And brms has only gotten better over time. To my knowledge, there are no textbooks on the market that highlight the brms package, which seems like an evil worth correcting. In addition, McElreath’s data wrangling code is based in the base R style and he made most of his figures with base R plots. Though there are benefits to sticking close to base R functions (e.g., less dependencies leading to a lower likelihood that your code will break in the future), there are downsides. For beginners, base R functions can be difficult both to learn and to read. Happily, in recent years Hadley Wickham and others have been developing a group of packages collectively called the tidyverse. These tidyverse packages (e.g., dplyr, tidyr, purrr) were developed according to an underlying philosophy and they are designed to work together coherently and seamlessly. Though not all within the R community share this opinion, I am among those who think the tydyverse style of coding is generally easier to learn and sufficiently powerful that these packages can accommodate the bulk of your data needs. I also find tydyverse-style syntax easier to read. And of course, the widely-used ggplot2 package is part of the tidyverse, too. To be clear, students can get a great education in both Bayesian statistics and programming in R with McElreath’s text just the way it is. Just go slow, work through all the examples, and read the text closely. It’s a pedagogical boon. I could not have done better or even closely so. But what I can offer is a parallel introduction on how to fit the statistical models with the ever-improving and already-quite-impressive brms package. I can throw in examples of how to perform other operations according to the ethic of the tidyverse. And I can also offer glimpses of some of the other great packages in the R + Stan ecosystem, such as loo, bayesplot, and tidybayes. My assumptions about you If you’re looking at this project, I’m guessing you’re either a graduate student, a post-graduate academic, or a researcher of some sort. So I’m presuming you have at least a 101-level foundation in statistics. If you’re rusty, consider checking out Legler and Roback’s free bookdown text, Broadening Your Statistical Horizons before diving into Statistical Rethinking. I’m also assuming you understand the rudiments of R and have at least a vague idea about what the tidyverse is. If you’re totally new to R, consider starting with Peng’s R Programming for Data Science. And the best introduction to the tidyvese-style of data analysis I’ve found is Grolemund and Wickham’s R for Data Science, which I extensively link to throughout this project. That said, you do not need to be totally fluent in statistics or R. Otherwise why would you need this project, anyway? IMO, the most important things are curiosity, a willingness to try, and persistent tinkering. I love this stuff. Hopefully you will, too. How to use and understand this project This project is not meant to stand alone. It’s a supplement to McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking text. I follow the structure of his text, chapter by chapter, translating his analyses into brms and tidyverse code. However, some of the sections in the text are composed entirely of equations and prose, leaving us nothing to translate. When we run into those sections, the corresponding sections in this project will sometimes be blank or omitted, though I do highlight some of the important points in quotes and prose of my own. So I imagine students might reference this project as they progress through McElreath’s text. I also imagine working data analysts might use this project in conjunction with the text as they flip to the specific sections that seem relevant to solving their data challenges. I reproduce the bulk of the figures in the text, too. The plots in the first few chapters are the closest to those in the text. However, I’m passionate about data visualization and like to play around with color palettes, formatting templates, and other conventions quite a bit. As a result, the plots in each chapter have their own look and feel. For more on some of these topics, check out chapters 3, 7, and 28 in R4DS, Healy’s Data Visualization: A practical introduction, or Wilke’s Fundamentals of Data Visualization. In this project, I use a handful of formatting conventions gleaned from R4DS, The tidyverse style guide, and R Markdown: The Definitive Guide. R code blocks and their output appear in a gray background. E.g., 2 + 2 == 5 ## [1] FALSE Functions are in a typewriter font and followed by parentheses, all atop a gray background (e.g., brm()). When I want to make explicit the package a given function comes from, I insert the double-colon operator :: between the package name and the function (e.g., tidybayes::mode_hdi()). R objects, such as data or function arguments, are in typewriter font atop gray backgrounds (e.g., chimpanzees, .width = .5). You can detect hyperlinks by their typical blue-colored font. In the text, McElreath indexed his models with names like m4.1 (i.e., the first model of Chapter 4). I primarily followed that convention, but replaced the m with a b to stand for the brms package. You can do this, too This project is powered by Yihui Xie’s bookdown package, which makes it easy to turn R markdown files into HTML, PDF, and EPUB. Go here to learn more about bookdown. While you’re at it, also check out Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund’s R Markdown: The Definitive Guide. And if you’re unacquainted with GitHub, check out Jenny Bryan’s Happy Git and GitHub for the useR. I’ve even blogged about what it was like putting together the first version of this project. The source code of the project is available here. We have updates I released the initial 0.9.0 version of this project in September 26, 2018. In April 19, 2019 came the 1.0.0 version. Some of the major changes were: All models were refit with the current official version of brms, 2.8.0. Adopting the seed argument within the brm() function made the model results more reproducible. The loo package was updated. As a consequence, our workflow for the WAIC and LOO changed, too. I improved the brms alternative to McElreath’s coeftab() function. I made better use of the tidyverse, especially some of the purrr functions. Particularly in the later chapters, there’s a greater emphasis on functions from the tidybayes package. Chapter 11 contains the updated brms 2.8.0 workflow for making custom distributions, using the beta-binomial model as the example. Chapter 12 received a new bonus section contrasting different methods for working with multilevel posteriors. Chapter 14 received a new bonus section introducing Bayesian meta-analysis and linking it to multilevel and measurement-error models. With the help of others within the community, I corrected many typos and streamlined some of the code (e.g., dropped an unnecessary use of the mi() function in section 14.2.1) And in some cases, I corrected sections that were just plain wrong (e.g., some of my initial attempts in section 3.3 were incorrect). In response to some reader requests, we finally have a PDF version! Making that happen required some formatting adjustments, resulting in version 1.0.1. Noteworthy changes include: Major revisions to the LaTeX syntax underlying many of the in-text equations (e.g., dropping the “eqnarray” environment for &quot;align*&quot;) Adjusting some of the image syntax Updating the reference for the Bayesian \\(R^2\\) (Gelman, Goodrich, Gabry, &amp; Vehtari, 2018) Though we’re into version 1.0.1, there’s room for improvement. There are still two models that need work. The current solution for model 10.6 is wrong, which I try to make clear in the prose. It also appears that the Gaussian process model from section 13.4 is off. Both models are beyond my current skill set and friendly suggestions are welcome. In addition to modeling concerns, typos may yet be looming and I’m sure there are places where the code could be made more streamlined, more elegant, or just more in-line with the tidyverse style. Which is all to say, I hope to release better and more useful updates in the future.

["the-golem-of-prague.html", "Chapter 2 The Golem of Prague 2 Statistical golems Reference Session info", " Chapter 2 The Golem of Prague Figure 2.1: Rabbi Loew and Golem by Mikoláš Aleš, 1899 As he opened the chapter, McElreath told us that ultimately Judah was forced to destroy the golem, as its combination of extraordinary power with clumsiness eventually led to innocent deaths. Wiping away one letter from the inscription emet to spell instead met, “death,” Rabbi Judah decommissioned the robot. 2 Statistical golems Scientists also make golems. Our golems rarely have physical form, but they too are often made of clay, living in silicon as computer code. These golems are scientific model. But these golems have real effects on the world, through the predictions they make and the intuitions they challenge or inspire. A concern with truth enlivens these models, but just like a golem or a modern robot, scientific models are neither true nor false, neither prophets nor charlatans. Rather they are constructs engineered for some purpose. These constructs are incredibly powerful, dutifully conducting their programmed calculations. (p. 1, emphasis in the original) There are a lot of great points, themes, methods, and factoids in this text. For me, one of the most powerful themes interlaced throughout the pages is how we should be skeptical of our models. Yes, learn Bayes. Pour over this book. Fit models until late into the night. But please don’t fall into blind love with their elegance and power. If we all knew what we were doing, there’d be no need for science. For more wise deflation along these lines, do check out A personal essay on Bayes factors, Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea: Tensions Between Scientific Judgement and Statistical Model Selection and Science, statistics and the problem of “pretty good inference”, a blog, paper and talk by the inimitable Danielle Navarro. Anyway, McElreath left us no code or figures to translate in this chapter. But before you skip off to the next one, why not invest a little time soaking in this chapter’s material by watching McElreath present it? He’s an engaging speaker and the material in his online lectures does not entirely overlap with that in the text. Reference McElreath, R. (2016).

I’m no historian and cannot vouch for its accuracy, so make of it what you will. McElreath described the thrust of this chapter this way: In this chapter, you will begin to build Bayesian models. The way that Bayesian models learn from evidence is arguably optimal in the small world. When their assumptions approximate reality, they also perform well in the large world. But large world performance has to be demonstrated rather than logically deduced. (p. 20) Indeed. 3.1 The garden of forking data Gelman and Loken wrote a great paper by this name. 3.1.1 Counting possibilities. Throughout this project, we’ll use the tidyverse for data wrangling. library(tidyverse) If you are new to tidyverse-style syntax, possibly the oddest component is the pipe (i.e., %&gt;%). I’m not going to explain the %&gt;% in this project, but you might learn more about in this brief clip, starting around minute 21:25 in this talk by Wickham, or in section 5.6.1 from Grolemund and Wickham’s R for Data Science. Really, all of Chapter 5 of R4DS is just great for new R and new tidyverse users. And R4DS Chapter 3 is a nice introduction to plotting with ggplot2. Other than the pipe, the other big thing to be aware of is tibbles. For our purposes, think of a tibble as a data object with two dimensions defined by rows and columns. And importantly, tibbles are just special types of data frames. So whenever we talk about data frames, we’re also talking about tibbles. For more on the topic, check out R4SD, Chapter 10. So, if we’re willing to code the marbles as 0 = “white” 1 = “blue”, we can arrange the possibility data in a tibble as follows. d &lt;- tibble(p_1 = 0, p_2 = rep(1:0, times = c(1, 3)), p_3 = rep(1:0, times = c(2, 2)), p_4 = rep(1:0, times = c(3, 1)), p_5 = 1) head(d) ## # A tibble: 4 x 5 ## p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4 p_5 ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0 1 1 1 1 ## 2 0 0 1 1 1 ## 3 0 0 0 1 1 ## 4 0 0 0 0 1 You might depict the possibility data in a plot. d %&gt;% gather() %&gt;% mutate(x = rep(1:4, times = 5), possibility = rep(1:5, each = 4)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = x, y = possibility, fill = value %&gt;% as.character())) + geom_point(shape = 21, size = 5) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;white&quot;, &quot;navy&quot;)) + scale_x_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(.75, 4.25), ylim = c(.75, 5.25)) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) As a quick aside, check out Suzan Baert’s blog post Data Wrangling Part 2: Transforming your columns into the right shape for an extensive discussion on dplyr::mutate() and dplyr::gather(). Here’s the basic structure of the possibilities per marble draw. tibble(draw = 1:3, marbles = 4) %&gt;% mutate(possibilities = marbles ^ draw) %&gt;% knitr::kable() draw marbles possibilities 1 4 4 2 4 16 3 4 64 If you walk that out a little, you can structure the data required to approach Figure 2.2.

If you assign a value to an object in R (e.g., dog &lt;- 1) and just hit return, nothing will immediately pop up in the console. You have to actually execute dog before R will return 1. But if you wrap the code within parentheses (e.g., (dog &lt;- 1)), R will perform the assignment and return the value as if you had executed dog. But we digress.

We may have prior information about the relative plausibility of each conjecture. This prior information could arise from knowledge of how the contents of the bag were generated. It could also arise from previous data. Or we might want to act as if we had prior information, so we can build conservatism into the analysis. Whatever the source, it would help to have a way to use prior information. Luckily there is a natural solution: Just multiply the prior count by the new count.

The opening sentences in this subsection are important: “It is helpful to think of this strategy as adhering to a principle of honest ignorance: When we don’t know what caused the data, potential causes that may produce the data in more ways are more plausible” (p. 26, emphasis in the original). We can define our updated plausibility as: plausibility of after seeing \\(\\propto\\) ways can produce \\(\\times\\) prior plausibility of In other words: \\[ \\text{plausibility of } p \\text{ after } D_{\\text{new}} \\propto \\text{ ways } p \\text{ can produce } D_{\\text{new}} \\times \\text{ prior plausibility of } p \\] But since we have to standardize the results to get them into a probability metric, the full equation is: \\[ \\text{plausibility of } p \\text{ after } D_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{\\text{ ways } p \\text{ can produce } D_{\\text{new}} \\times \\text{ prior plausibility of } p}{\\text{sum of the products}} \\] You might make the table in the middle of page 27 like this. t %&gt;% select(p_1:p_4) %&gt;% mutate(p = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .25), `ways to produce data` = c(0, 3, 8, 9, 0)) %&gt;% mutate(plausibility = `ways to produce data` / sum(`ways to produce data`)) ## # A tibble: 5 x 7 ## p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4 p `ways to produce data` plausibility ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 w w w w 0 0 0 ## 2 b w w w 0.25 3 0.15 ## 3 b b w w 0.5 8 0.4 ## 4 b b b w 0.75 9 0.45 ## 5 b b b b 1 0 0 We just computed the plausibilities, but here’s McElreath’s R code 2.1. ways &lt;- c(0, 3, 8, 9, 0) ways / sum(ways) ## [1] 0.00 0.15 0.40 0.45 0.00 3.2 Building a model We might save our globe-tossing data in a tibble.

Bayesian data analysis usually means producing a story for how the data came to be. This story may be descriptive, specifying associations that can be used to predict outcomes, given observations. Or it may be causal, a theory of how come events produce other events. Typically, any story you intend to be causal may also be descriptive. But many descriptive stories are hard to interpret causally. But all data stories are complete, in the sense that they are sufficient for specifying an algorithm for simulating new data. (p. 28, emphasis in the original) 3.2.2 Bayesian updating. Here we’ll add the cumulative number of trials, n_trials, and the cumulative number of successes, n_successes (i.e., toss == &quot;w&quot;), to the data.

The solid ones are normalized likelihoods. If you don’t normalize (i.e., divide the density by the sum of the density), their respective heights don’t match up with those in the text. Furthermore, it’s the normalization that makes them directly comparable. To learn more about dplyr::group_by() and its opposite dplyr::ungroup(), check out R4DS, Chapter 5.

It may be that Bayesian inference is the best general purpose method of inference known. However, Bayesian inference is much less powerful than we’d like it to be. There is no approach to inference that provides universal guarantees. No branch of applied mathematics has unfettered access to reality, because math is not discovered, like the proton. Instead it is invented, like the shovel. (p. 32) 3.3 Components of the model a likelihood function: “the number of ways each conjecture could produce an observation” one or more parameters: “the accumulated number of ways each conjecture cold produce the entire data” a prior: “the initial plausibility of each conjectured cause of the data” 3.3.1 Likelihood. If you let the count of water be \\(w\\) and the number of tosses be \\(n\\), then the binomial likelihood may be expressed as: \\[\\text{Pr} (w|n, p) = \\frac{n!}{w!(n - w)!} p^w (1 - p)^{n - w}\\] Given a probability of .5, the binomial likelihood of 6 out of 9 tosses coming out water is: dbinom(x = 6, size = 9, prob = .5) ## [1] 0.1640625 McElreath suggested we change the values of prob. Let’s do so over the parameter space. tibble(prob = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = .01)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = prob, y = dbinom(x = 6, size = 9, prob = prob))) + geom_line() + labs(x = &quot;probability&quot;, y = &quot;binomial likelihood&quot;) + theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) 3.3.2 Parameters. McElreath started off his Rethinking: Datum or parameter? box with: It is typical to conceive of data and parameters as completely different kinds of entities. Data are measures and known; parameters are unknown and must be estimated from data. Usefully, in the Bayesian framework the distinction between a datum and a parameter is fuzzy. (p. 34) For more in this topic, check out his lecture Understanding Bayesian Statistics without Frequentist Language. 3.3.3 Prior. So where do priors come from? They are engineering assumptions, chosen to help the machine learn. The flat prior in Figure 2.5 is very common, but it is hardly ever the best prior. You’ll see later in the book that priors that gently nudge the machine usually improve inference. Such priors are sometimes called regularizing or weakly informative priors. (p. 35) To learn more about “regularizing or weakly informative priors,” check out the Prior Choice Recommendations wiki from the Stan team. 3.3.3.1 Overthinking: Prior as a probability distribution McElreath said that “for a uniform prior from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\), the probability of any point in the interval is \\(1 / (b - a)\\)” (p. 35). Let’s try that out. To keep things simple, we’ll hold \\(a\\) constant while varying the values for \\(b\\). tibble(a = 0, b = c(1, 1.5, 2, 3, 9)) %&gt;% mutate(prob = 1 / (b - a)) ## # A tibble: 5 x 3 ## a b prob ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0 1 1 ## 2 0 1.5 0.667 ## 3 0 2 0.5 ## 4 0 3 0.333 ## 5 0 9 0.111 I like to verify things with plots. tibble(a = 0, b = c(1, 1.5, 2, 3, 9)) %&gt;% expand(nesting(a, b), parameter_space = seq(from = 0, to = 9, length.out = 500)) %&gt;% mutate(prob = dunif(parameter_space, a, b), b = str_c(&quot;b = &quot;, b)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = parameter_space, ymin = 0, ymax = prob)) + geom_ribbon() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1:3, 9)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1/9, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 1), labels = c(&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1/9&quot;, &quot;1/3&quot;, &quot;1/2&quot;, &quot;2/3&quot;, &quot;1&quot;)) + theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()) + facet_wrap(~b, ncol = 5) And as we’ll learn much later in the project, the \\(\\text{Uniform} (0, 1)\\) distribution is special in that we can also express it as the beta distribution for which \\(\\alpha = 1 \\text{ and } \\beta = 1\\). E.g., tibble(parameter_space = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 50)) %&gt;% mutate(prob = dbeta(parameter_space, 1, 1)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = parameter_space, ymin = 0, ymax = prob)) + geom_ribbon() + coord_cartesian(ylim = 0:2) + theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) 3.3.4 Posterior. If we continue to focus on the globe tossing example, the posterior probability a toss will be water may be expressed as: \\[\\text{Pr} (p|w) = \\frac{\\text{Pr} (w|p) \\text{Pr} (p)}{\\text{Pr} (w)}\\] More generically and in words, this is: \\[\\text{Posterior} = \\frac{\\text{Likelihood} \\times \\text{Prior}}{\\text{Average Likelihood}}\\] 3.4 Making the model go Here’s the data wrangling for Figure 2.6. sequence_length &lt;- 1e3 d &lt;- tibble(probability = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = sequence_length)) %&gt;% expand(probability, row = c(&quot;flat&quot;, &quot;stepped&quot;, &quot;Laplace&quot;)) %&gt;% arrange(row, probability) %&gt;% mutate(prior = ifelse(row == &quot;flat&quot;, 1, ifelse(row == &quot;stepped&quot;, rep(0:1, each = sequence_length / 2), exp(-abs(probability - .5) / .25) / ( 2 * .25))), likelihood = dbinom(x = 6, size = 9, prob = probability)) %&gt;% group_by(row) %&gt;% mutate(posterior = prior * likelihood / sum(prior * likelihood)) %&gt;% gather(key, value, -probability, -row) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% mutate(key = factor(key, levels = c(&quot;prior&quot;, &quot;likelihood&quot;, &quot;posterior&quot;)), row = factor(row, levels = c(&quot;flat&quot;, &quot;stepped&quot;, &quot;Laplace&quot;))) To learn more about dplyr::arrange(), chech out R4DS, Chapter 5.3. In order to avoid unnecessary facet labels for the rows, it was easier to just make each column of the plot separately and then recombine them with gridExtra::grid.arrange(). p1 &lt;- d %&gt;% filter(key == &quot;prior&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = probability, y = value)) + geom_line() + scale_x_continuous(NULL, breaks = c(0, .5, 1)) + scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) + labs(subtitle = &quot;prior&quot;) + theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), strip.background = element_blank(), strip.text = element_blank()) + facet_wrap(row ~ ., scales = &quot;free_y&quot;, ncol = 1) p2 &lt;- d %&gt;% filter(key == &quot;likelihood&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = probability, y = value)) + geom_line() + scale_x_continuous(NULL, breaks = c(0, .5, 1)) + scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) + labs(subtitle = &quot;likelihood&quot;) + theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), strip.background = element_blank(), strip.text = element_blank()) + facet_wrap(row ~ ., scales = &quot;free_y&quot;, ncol = 1) p3 &lt;- d %&gt;% filter(key == &quot;posterior&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = probability, y = value)) + geom_line() + scale_x_continuous(NULL, breaks = c(0, .5, 1)) + scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) + labs(subtitle = &quot;posterior&quot;) + theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), strip.background = element_blank(), strip.text = element_blank()) + facet_wrap(row ~ ., scales = &quot;free_y&quot;, ncol = 1) library(gridExtra) grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 3) I’m not sure if it’s the same McElreath used in the text, but the formula I used for the tirangle-shaped prior is the Laplace distribution with a location of .5 and a dispersion of .25. Also, to learn all about dplyr::filter(), check out Baert’s Data Wrangling Part 3: Basic and more advanced ways to filter rows. 3.4.1 Grid approximation. We just employed grid approximation over the last figure. In order to get nice smooth lines, we computed the posterior over 1000 evenly-spaced points on the probability space.

Since the main goal of this project is to highlight brms, we may as fit a model. This seems like an appropriately named subsection to do so. First we’ll have to load the package. library(brms) Here we’ll re-fit the last model from above wherein \\(w = 24\\) and \\(n = 36\\). globe_qa_brms &lt;- brm(data = list(w = 24), family = binomial(link = &quot;identity&quot;), w | trials(36) ~ 1, prior(beta(1, 1), class = Intercept), iter = 4000, warmup = 1000, control = list(adapt_delta = .9), seed = 4) The model output looks like so. print(globe_qa_brms) ## Family: binomial ## Links: mu = identity ## Formula: w | trials(36) ~ 1 ## Data: list(w = 24) (Number of observations: 1) ## Samples: 4 chains, each with iter = 4000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1; ## total post-warmup samples = 12000 ## ## Population-Level Effects: ## Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Eff.Sample Rhat ## Intercept 0.66 0.08 0.50 0.80 3579 1.00 ## ## Samples were drawn using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Eff.Sample ## is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential ## scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1). There’s a lot going on in that output, which we’ll start to clarify in Chapter 4. For now, focus on the ‘Intercept’ line. As we’ll also learn in Chapter 4, the intercept of a regression model with no predictors is the same as its mean. In the special case of a model using the binomial likelihood, the mean is the probability of a 1 in a given trial, \\(\\theta\\). Let’s plot the results of our model and compare them with those from rethinking::map(), above. posterior_samples(globe_qa_brms) %&gt;% mutate(n = &quot;n = 36&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = b_Intercept)) + geom_density(fill = &quot;black&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;proportion water&quot;) + xlim(0, 1) + theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) + facet_wrap(~n) If you’re still confused. Cool. This is just a preview. We’ll start walking through fitting models in brms in Chapter 4 and we’ll learn a lot about regression with the binomial likelihood in Chapter 10.
